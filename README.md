# Shield-Insurance

➡️ About the Company:

Shield Insurance offers flexible and affordable policies for all age groups. They operate in cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Indore, using multiple sales channels: offline agents, direct sales, an app, and a 
website.

➡️ Problem Statement:

Shield Insurance wanted to improve its decision-making through better data insights. They requested a pilot project to evaluate our ability to meet their needs before committing to a larger partnership.


➡️ Dashboard Overview:

I developed a dashboard with three key views:

1. General Analysis: A high-level overview of revenue and customer distribution, with monthly trends to track growth.

2. Sales Mode Analysis: Focuses on revenue and customer data across different sales channels, helping assess their performance.

3. Age Group Analysis: Breaks down policy sales and revenue by age group to identify the most valuable customer segments.
