## ➡️ Insights 

1.Offline agent is the primary sales channel, contributing 55% of total policies sold.
      Reason : personalized advice, trust, and ongoing support agents can offer, 
               especially for complex policies and claims.

2.Online policy purchases have seen a significant rise as per the observed trend, reflecting a growing shift towards digital convenience.
  Company should think of introducing #online Ai enabled voice chat assistance to guide 
  customers in selecting policies based on their needs could greatly enhance the purchasing experience and provide personalized support.

3.Customers from 31-40 age group are the largest contributor to revenue, with a settlement % of around 50%, making them the Premium customers.

4.Younger age groups (18-24 and 25-30) tend to hold policies with low base coverage amount.
   company should think of introducing policiy which cater the needs for age-group 25-30 as customers from this age-group are future primium customers.
